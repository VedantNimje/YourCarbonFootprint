Global Carbon Regulations and Compliance Requirements

EU CARBON BORDER ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM (CBAM)

Overview:
The EU CBAM is a carbon tariff system designed to prevent carbon leakage by putting a price on carbon emissions embedded in imported goods.

Timeline:
- October 2023: Transitional phase begins (reporting only)
- January 2026: Full implementation with financial obligations
- 2034: Full phase-in completed

Covered Sectors (Initial):
1. Cement
2. Iron and Steel
3. Aluminum
4. Fertilizers
5. Electricity
6. Hydrogen

Requirements:
- Importers must report embedded emissions in imported goods
- Purchase CBAM certificates corresponding to carbon price
- Certificates priced based on EU ETS (Emissions Trading System) weekly average
- Quarterly reporting of emissions data
- Annual surrender of CBAM certificates

Calculation Method:
- Direct emissions (Scope 1) from production process
- Indirect emissions (Scope 2) from electricity consumption
- Use actual emissions data or default values
- Must be verified by accredited verifier

Penalties:
- €10-50 per ton of CO2 for non-compliance
- Potential import restrictions

Impact on Asian Exporters:
- Companies exporting to EU must track and report carbon emissions
- Need robust carbon accounting systems
- May need third-party verification
- Competitive advantage for low-carbon producers

JAPAN GX LEAGUE (GREEN TRANSFORMATION LEAGUE)

Overview:
Japan's voluntary carbon trading and reduction initiative launched in 2023, transitioning to mandatory emissions trading system.

   - Gradual tightening of caps

2. Carbon Pricing:
   - Initial price: ¥289/tCO2 (fossil fuel levy)
   - Gradual increase to ¥10,000/tCO2 by 2033
   - Two-tier system: fossil fuel levy + emissions trading

3. Disclosure Requirements:
   - Annual emissions reporting
   - Reduction target setting
   - Progress tracking and public disclosure

4. Support Measures:
   - Government subsidies for green technology
   - Tax incentives for renewable energy
   - Support for carbon capture and storage (CCS)

Covered Emissions:
- Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions
- Energy-intensive industries prioritized
- Gradual expansion to other sectors

INDONESIA EMISSIONS TRADING SCHEME (ETS) AND ENERGY TRANSITION PROGRAM (ETP)

Indonesia ETS:

Launch: Pilot phase started in 2023, focusing on coal-fired power plants

Coverage:
- Coal-fired power plants (initial phase)
- Expansion to other sectors planned
- Targets 50+ power plants

Mechanism:
- Cap-and-trade system
- Baseline-and-credit approach
- Free allocation initially, transitioning to auctioning

Targets:
- 29% emission reduction by 2030 (unconditional)
- 41% reduction with international support
- Net-zero by 2060

Energy Transition Program (ETP):

Overview:
Partnership with international organizations to accelerate coal phase-out and renewable energy adoption.

Key Components:
1. Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP):
   - $20 billion commitment from international partners
   - Accelerate renewable energy deployment
   - Early retirement of coal plants

2. Renewable Energy Targets:
   - 23% renewable energy by 2025
   - 31% by 2030
   - Significant solar and wind capacity additions

3. Carbon Tax:
   - Implemented in April 2022
   - Initial rate: IDR 30,000/tCO2e (~$2/tCO2e)
   - Applied to coal-fired power plants
   - Gradual expansion to other sectors

Compliance Requirements:
- Emissions monitoring and reporting
- Third-party verification
- Participation in carbon market
- Renewable energy certificates (RECs)
