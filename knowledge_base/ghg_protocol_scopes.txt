GHG Protocol - Greenhouse Gas Emission Scopes

SCOPE 1: DIRECT EMISSIONS
Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse gas emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by an organization. These include:

1. Stationary Combustion:
   - Emissions from fuel combustion in boilers, furnaces, burners, turbines, heaters, incinerators, engines, and flares
   - Common fuels: natural gas, diesel, fuel oil, coal, propane, gasoline
   - Formula: Fuel consumed (liters or kg) × Emission factor (kgCO2e/liter or kg)

2. Mobile Combustion:
   - Emissions from transportation owned or controlled by the organization
   - Company vehicles, trucks, aircraft, ships, trains
   - Formula: Distance traveled (km) × Emission factor (kgCO2e/km) OR Fuel consumed × Emission factor

3. Process Emissions:
   - Emissions from physical or chemical processing
   - Examples: cement production, aluminum smelting, chemical manufacturing
   - Emissions from industrial processes that chemically or physically transform materials

4. Fugitive Emissions:
   - Intentional or unintentional releases of GHGs
   - Examples: refrigerant leakage from air conditioning, methane leakage from natural gas systems
   - HFC, PFC, SF6 emissions from equipment

SCOPE 2: INDIRECT EMISSIONS FROM PURCHASED ENERGY
Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heat, or cooling. Key points:

1. Purchased Electricity:
   - Emissions from electricity consumed by the organization
   - Formula: Electricity consumed (kWh) × Grid emission factor (kgCO2e/kWh)
   - Location-based method: Uses average emission factor for the grid
   - Market-based method: Uses emission factor from specific supplier or renewable energy certificates

2. Purchased Heat and Steam:
   - Emissions from purchased thermal energy
   - District heating systems, purchased steam for industrial processes

3. Purchased Cooling:
   - Emissions from purchased chilled water or cooling services
   - District cooling systems

Important Notes:
- Scope 2 emissions physically occur at the facility where electricity/energy is generated
- Organizations only account for energy they purchase and consume
- Renewable energy purchases can reduce Scope 2 emissions under market-based accounting

SCOPE 3: OTHER INDIRECT EMISSIONS
Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur in the value chain. There are 15 categories:

Upstream Categories:
1. Purchased Goods and Services: Emissions from production of goods/services purchased
2. Capital Goods: Emissions from production of capital goods (equipment, buildings, vehicles)
3. Fuel and Energy Related Activities: Emissions from extraction, production, and transportation of fuels and energy
4. Upstream Transportation and Distribution: Transportation and distribution of purchased products
5. Waste Generated in Operations: Disposal and treatment of waste generated
6. Business Travel: Employee travel for business purposes (not in company-owned vehicles)
7. Employee Commuting: Emissions from employee commuting
8. Upstream Leased Assets: Operation of assets leased by the reporting company

Downstream Categories:
9. Downstream Transportation and Distribution: Transportation and distribution of sold products
10. Processing of Sold Products: Processing of intermediate products by third parties
11. Use of Sold Products: End-use of goods and services sold
12. End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products: Disposal and treatment of products at end of life
13. Downstream Leased Assets: Operation of assets owned and leased to others
14. Franchises: Operation of franchises
15. Investments: Operation of investments (equity, debt, project finance)

Scope 3 Calculation Approaches:
- Spend-based method: Expenditure × Emission factor
- Activity-based method: Activity data × Emission factor
- Average-data method: Industry averages or proxy data
- Supplier-specific method: Data from specific suppliers

EMISSION FACTORS
Emission factors convert activity data into GHG emissions. Sources include:
- IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)
- National GHG inventories
- EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)
- DEFRA (UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs)
- IEA (International Energy Agency)
- Industry-specific databases

Common Emission Factors:
- Natural Gas: ~2.0 kgCO2e/m³ or ~0.2 kgCO2e/kWh
- Diesel: ~2.7 kgCO2e/liter
- Gasoline: ~2.3 kgCO2e/liter
- Electricity (varies by grid): 0.2-1.0 kgCO2e/kWh
- Air Travel: 0.15-0.25 kgCO2e/km (varies by class and distance)

ORGANIZATIONAL BOUNDARIES
Organizations must define boundaries using one of these approaches:
1. Equity Share: Account for emissions based on ownership percentage
2. Financial Control: Account for emissions from operations with financial control
3. Operational Control: Account for emissions from operations with operational control

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
- Report Scope 1 and Scope 2 separately
- Scope 3 reporting is optional but recommended
- Use consistent methodology year-over-year
- Document assumptions, emission factors, and calculation methods
- Report in metric tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e)
